HOW TO SETUP A SERVER:
You will need to sepecify the next command: -S (your ipv4) -P (your port). Be sure those data are okay in your machine, otherwise it wont work correctly. And thats it, simple as that.


HOW TO SEND MESSAGES:
Now, you will notice a json file, where you will see 3 things: server[IP,PORT], username[username]. Those values can be modify in needs of who will be recieving the message, its like a group. If you only want to be sure that a only 1 server will recieve the data, then delete the others, you can add as many server as you want. The username can be modify too, this is what the server will be seeing as "sended from".
